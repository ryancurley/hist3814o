# INTERESTING ANNOTATION

I find this particular annotation to be interesting as it really strikes a chord with me. It seems so obious and simple but also touches on the how people are really prideful and would like to be recognized for all of their efforts. At times to me it seems like individuals are more concerned with  receiving credit than actually providing other people with useful information through arguments that have been well thought out. I understand that people would be nervous or unhappy with the fact that they could spend years providing the groundwork and basis for a strong argument and if they present all their work to other academics and the public at large during their research phase they are risking someone else claiming what their doing as their own. 
However, if you have collected all your work online where people can view it they would also be able to see **when** you came up with your initial thoughts and opinions and what data or events you based your arguments off of. If every historian kept detailed notes of their work in this way it would be simple to tell who has been coasting off of the work of others and presumably that individual would receive a reputation for either claiming other people's work as their own or misrepresenting the information they've found in their primary sources.

While it might force some people to swallow their pride, ultimately I think it would be a much better practice if your history of work and primary sources were digitized and published, alongside your finished paper. As well, others could build off of your work, advancing the field of study farther than if a historian was working in seclusion.
