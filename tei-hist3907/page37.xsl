               <p> <placeName key= "Britain" ref= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"> </placeName> than in <placeName key= "America" ref= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"> </placeName>?  Is there something so peculiar in the moral atmosphere of a British colony, that the "justice, gentleness, pity, and humility," which wither elsewhere under the influence of slavery, should there flourish; that conscience should there retain its dominion, and prevent all the hideous effects so well described as teh inevitable result of unmeausred despotism? -- Is "the value of liberty" less known, and are "its principles" less understood in <placeName key= "England" ref= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"> </placeName> than in <placeName key= "America" ref= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"> </placeName> ? Are "the feelings and practices" involved in our system of colonial bondage less oppossed to those principles, or are they less "the consummation of wickedness," because they exist under the sanction of the British government, rather than under that of the United States? Is it less the duty of every Englishmanthan of "every American, who loves his country, to dedicate his whole life, and every faculty of his soul, to efface this foul stain from its character?" In "this great and humane country" are there "no scourgers of slaves?" Can we forget that "all are not free with us?" Or has the enfranchisement of our colonial bondsmen indeed taken place? And are those laws at length abrogated in the British colonies, which, "with impious caprice, limit the greates of God's blessing to the colour of the body?" <interp key= "Pamphlet was written in 1823 but not until 1833 that legislation passed to ban slavery" n= "Henry, Natasha L. "Slavery Abolition Act." Encyclopedia Britannica" cert= "high" ref= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavery-Abolition-Act"> </interp>.We have done much, it is true, to effect the universal abolition of the Slave-trade ; but what single legislative measure have we, as a nation, yet adopted, not merely for "tearing off the manacles" of our Black and Coloured fellow-subjects in the colonies, but for lightening the chains of their servitude, for protecting them against oppression, for raising them in the scale of being? The pathos of a few occasional speeches, the barren generalities of an address to the Crown, the printing of reams of barbarous enactment, or horrid recitals, or studies apologies for slavery, will no fulfill the obligations we are under to these wretched outcasts.<p>
